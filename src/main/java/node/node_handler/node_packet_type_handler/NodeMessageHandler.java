 *      This is the handler for the Packet Type MESSAGE. This extends the Abstract
 *      class 'Packet handler'
 * 
 *      The handle method splits the recieved packet's Payload's Json into a Java HashMap
 *      variable called "PayloadKeyValuePair" (HashMap is still Key Value pair just makes it
 *      accessable). This variable is declared in the SuperClass 'PacketHandler'
 * 
 *      The recieved packet will be instansiated inside the NodeServerHandler and 
 *      then sent here when the payload will be handled accordingly
 * 
 *      Response packet will be generated in the NodeServerHandler
